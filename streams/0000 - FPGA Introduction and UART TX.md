# FPGA Introduciton and UART TX

The final title was **Playing with an FPGA (Arty Z7-20)**

## Plan

1. Introduce myself
2. Introduce the concept behind FPGAs and other compute units
   1. CPU
   2. GPU
   3. Photonic
   4. Quantum
   5. Neuromorphic
3. Vivado process
   1. Block design
   2. HDL Wrapper
   3. Sythesize
   4. Implement
   5. Bitstream
   6. Hardware
4. Making an application using Vitis in `C`

## Notes

* Streamed on May 10th, 2024 at 8 PM EDT for 2 hours, 46 minutes and 55 seconds.
* The sound amplitude was very low, was setup at -12dB on OBS. Will change to -3dB for next stream.
* The FPGA concept explication was chaotic and not very helpful. Might try to explain it better.
* Need to move the mic when going to the drawing board.
* A lot of "hmmm"... maybe try to talk more calmly
* The drawying of neurons were a little bad. Taking more time would have been better.

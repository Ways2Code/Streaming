# UART RX & TX along with Full-Adder

The final title was **Arty Z7-20 - Designing a CPU - UART TX & RX**

## Plan

1. Quick introduction
2. Looking up `XUartPs C module`
   1. Changing `xil_printf` with `XUartPs_Send`
   2. Use `XUartPs_Recv`
3. Full-Adder
   1. Binary Counting
   2. Binary Addition
   3. `AND`, `OR`, `NOR`, and `XOR` logic gates
   4. Implementing the Full-Adder
4. Testbench the Full-Adder

## Notes

* Remove my hand from my mouth when talking.
* I've been RAIDED!!! Need a Twitch cheatsheet to be able to raid other streamers.
  * RAID, when someone follow, subscribe, etc.
  * [Cheatography](https://cheatography.com/haywardgg/cheat-sheets/twitch/)
* Forgot to promote on **Thread** and **Reddit**.
* Had "a lot" of interaction, didn't had time to do the full adder - only the half-adder.
* Still a lot of *hummm*, also *sorry*.
* Not seeing the chat on stream is hard to follow my reaction
* Forget a lot of changing the right screen setup back

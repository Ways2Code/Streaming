# Naive 8-bit Multiplier

The final tital was **Arty Z7-20 - Designing a CPU - Making a naive 8x8 multiplier**

## Plan

1. Quick Introduction.
2. Talk about RISC-V softcores.
3. Complete the Full-Adder;
   1. Quick revision of logic gates.
   2. Truth table.
   3. Karnaugth table?
4. 16-bit adder.
5. Shift register.
6. Combinatorial vs sequential circuit.
7. Testbench.
